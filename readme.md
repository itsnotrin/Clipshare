## What is ClipShare?
Clipshare is an application that I made with well... sharing your clips easily in mind. I've been using Medal and YouTube for a while however I was tired of waiting for processing or to upload to an external server whilst in a game, therefore having a negative impact on my ping.

So I thought, I've already got a decent home server. Why not just make my own sort of Medal?

This is what I want ClipShare to be. Practically a drop in replacement for the likes of Medal.

## What can and can't Clipshare do?
What I don't want to do with ClipShare:
* Turn it into yet another Clip recording software.\
There are already plenty of these around and I don't need to add to an already full-up ocean.

* Make a complicated Editor no-one can use.\
If you want to edit your clips, use editing software. Not your clip software. It's as simple as that in my opinion. There will be trimming features added into this to accomodate for people like me who aren't going to fire up an Editor to trim their 1 min 30 sec clip when they can do it quickly in the software.

* Make it paid.\
I want ClipShare to continue to be a free service, easily accessible by anyone. Fully Open source and transparent with our choices, whilst still listening to other people's suggestions.

What I want to do with ClipShare:
* Make a nice mobile app or easy to use web UI for mobile.\
Nothing sucks more than having an amazing app if you're on PC but then it going to hell as soon as you try to use it on the go to show your friends your clips IRL.

* Easy to upload clips.\
I want it to be as simple as dropping a Clip into the app / website and it'll begin to upload. You give it a title, optionally give it a description and it's done, simple as that.

* Easy to share clips.\
I want a one click solution that lets you just have the link and get on with sharing it to friends. No shenanigans regarding anything else.

* Automated Meta tags.\
I want the links that are shared to share Meta tags from the video itself. The title, amount of views, length etc. That way people can view any information they may want to know at a quick glance, rather than having to load up the site.

* Fast.\
I want the site to be fast to use and navigate. It's all good having a beautiful app but if it's as slow as a snail then there's no point in using it.
